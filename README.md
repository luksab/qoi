# My quick qoi implementation
This repository contains an implementation of the Quite OK Image Format
[qoi](https://qoiformat.org) and a command line tool to convert images to and from qoi.

It was implemented in two days from only looking at the [qoi specification](https://qoiformat.org/qoi-specification.pdf) and was a lot of fun.

While it does deliver a functional implementation, it is probably not a good idea to use it, as there surely are implementations.
